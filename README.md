## Hello, welcome to my website (Under construction).

I am a DPhil student at the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://github.com/ftraposo/home/edit/master/README.md). 
I received a Master's in Public Policy from the University of Oxford, and a Master's in Economics at Queen Mary University of London.

My research interest include political economy and behavioural economics.
